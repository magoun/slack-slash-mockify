# slack-slash-mockify (SSM)

This app runs on glitch.me to return a "mockified" version of the input text, a la the Mocking Spongebob meme ([example](https://stopthatrightnow.github.io/)).

Once this is running on Glitch, configure slack to utilize the endpoint using [Slack's guide](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands).

SSM now supports additional "commands": You can clapify, binify / definify, flagify, swearify, and even shopify (kinda)!
Try them out using the pattern in the following example and see what you think!

`/mockify clapify i love this!`
